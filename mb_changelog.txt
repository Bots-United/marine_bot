Marine Bot 0.92b change log

FIXED 'Cease fire' message bug (bot used his enemy name instead of the guilty teammate name)
FIXED crash due to array pointer at -1 position in couple path routines (no idea why it didn't use to crash the game before as this bug was present since the path system introduction in version 0.6beta)
FIXED string allocation crash (why this bug didn't cause crashes before is beyond me)
FIXED debug_cross toggle option (if used without argument it only turned it 'on' instead of switching between 'on' and 'off')
Bot can now see enemy through most fence like objects
FIXED reading FA Text messages on obj maps (obj_armory triggers didn't work at all due to extra string variable being sent there)
Bot can now read the fancy HUD messages (triggers are finally available even on maps like obj_thanatos)
UPDATED obj_thanatos waypoints (added triggers, avoid paths and generally improved and fixed)
UPDATED obj_armory waypoints (triggers didn't match the game messages and fixed one cross setting)
ADDED obj_vengeance waypoints (based on basic layout someone sent me ages ago ... they weren't signed, but it could have been someone from our friends at YIS)
UPDATED cross waypoint behaviour (bot can read the overall setting better and should be a little clever there)
UPDATED 'debug_cross' feedback so the waypointers have better idea how the bot decides there
FIXED trigger_camera crash on obj_armory, obj_willow and tc_thebes (also known as the cutscenes crash ... it used to crash when a team captured the weapon and you've been watching the cutscenes)
UPDATED ps_upham waypoints (avoid paths, added a few new paths and fixed couple ugly errors that made MB log file grow over 1 megabyte)
FIXED bot using grenades (the bot wasn't really able to handle the fuse removal so any thrown grenade in FA version 2.8 and above was just a coincidence)
UPDATED ps_river waypoints (avoid paths and general improvement)
FIXED bot sniper-hunters camping at sniper paths (they should just scout those paths not camp there)
FIXED bot machinegun-hunters camping at gunner paths (again they should just scout such paths not camp there)
FIXED occasional incorrect behaviour on waypoint with wait time (if this waypoint was the first waypoint the bot reached after leaving the cross waypoint then any path limiting factors were ignored)
FIXED goback waypoint breaking small range behaviour (the bot stopped slowing down at small range waypoints after the goback turn)
UPDATED console command help (few commands were missing and some had wrong info, fixed also one length overflow causing missing characters at the end of the line)
UPDATED the weapon data files due to changes in the grenade code (they now use the base delay variable as well)
FIXED wrong weapon data file for version 2.5 (the data inside the file were for 2.8 and above so due to big changes between the versions the weapons didn't match at all and must have caused fatal bugs in weapon use)
FIXED parachute detection in spawn (the bot couldn't pass the parachute waypoint because the backward compatibility code used to reset parachute icon whenever the bot respawned right on top of the parachute bag)
FIXED throwing the parachute off in old FA versions (the way FA 2.4-2.65 informed the client about parachute used to reset one variable that led to faulty parachute behaviour after the first landing)
FIXED team kill detection (bot ignored team mates in his line of sight when shooting at his target, the whole code wasn't ready, now it's finished and turned on so there should be less TKs)
ADDED client command 'wpt loadunsupportedversion5' (allows waypoint and path conversion from waypoint system ver. 5 in MB0.8b, this command isn't available on Dedicated server, see MB documentation for more info)
UPDATED waypoint self-cleaning (ammobox+goback is invalid waypoint type combination yet it was still present in official waypoints, now the self-cleaning routine will catch it and fix it right on waypoint load)
ADDED client command 'wpt repair range' (it can automatically repair poorly designed waypoint range setting by reducing it in order to fix any solid object intersection)
ADDED client command 'wpt repair range_and_position' (a lot more agressive than the range alone as it combines range reducing with repositioning the waypoint itself)
ADDED client command 'wpt repair pathend' (it can automatically repair missing goback waypoint on any path that ends in nowhere ie. not at cross and like, also it can turn one-way path into two-way where possible)
ADDED client command 'wpt repair pathmerge' (it can automatically repair invalid path merge ... you know when one path starts on the same waypoint as another path ends and we aren't connected to a cross waypoint)
UPDATED ps_crash waypoints (avoid paths, added one new path, fixed couple ugly errors on blue paths in red spawn area and a few other minor tweaks)
ADDED client command 'pathwpt printall <arg>' (lists all used paths on current map if used without arg or all paths on waypoint specified by the arg or on closest waypoint if you use 'nearby' as the argument)
Console command help no longer uses the notify area (top left corner on the sreen) ... these are now printed directly into the console
ADDED client command 'wpt repair sniperspot' (it can automatically repair incorrectly set sniper spot at the end of a path, it can add missing aim waypoint, turn the waypoint into a sniper one or even set some wait time)
