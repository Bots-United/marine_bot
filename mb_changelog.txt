Marine Bot 0.93b change log

UPDATED MB web page HUD message (it doesn't show marinebot.net anymore because there is no content there, now it shows marinebot.xf.cz)
FIXED client command 'wpt repair masterrepair' not available (it will run all available repair functions in specific order, range and position functions are skipped)
FIXED client command 'test aimcode' not available (it will turn experimental aim code on or off, this new aim code isn't fully finished yet so not for general use)
FIXED bots shooting beams when they saw their target (the .dll was actually compiled as 'debug' code instead of 'release' code so many routines used to test stuff were then present in game)
ADDED client command 'pathwpt checkproblems' (it will test all paths for possible problems like a goback waypoint in one-way path or path ending in a void, it can write all findings in MB error log if 'save' argument is used)
Updated ps_crash waypoints (fixed one bad cross waypoint layout near the house and a problem with goback waypoint in the church pushpoint area)
FIXED client command 'pathwpt highlight' not turning waypoints and paths on (you had to use 'pathwpt show' command in order to actually see any path, now it will turn waypoints and paths on by default)
Updated obj_sweden waypoints (fixed one missing trigger setting, one bad cross waypoint layout, removed the door waypoint at the howitzer house makeing the bots be stuck there and fixed couple goback waypoint in one-way path bugs)
Updated obj_willow waypoints (fixed one non fatal error with red team path in their goal area, it didn't end properly at cross waypoint)
Updated ps_outlands waypoints (fixed couple goback waypoint in one-way path problems and added missing wait times on a few blue team waypoints)
Updated obj_armory waypoints (fixed one invalid path merge in blue team spawn area)
Updated ps_inlands waypoints (extended two paths near blue team spawn)
Updated sd_durandal waypoints (fixed 3 bugs in the central bridge area, goback waypoint in one-way path, invalid path merge and some invalid path ends)
Updated tc_basrah waypoints (converted them into up-to-date waypoint version and fixed two invalid path ends, yet these are still unfinished and would need serious work)
Updated tc_battlefield_r2 waypoints (converted them into up-to-date waypoint version and fixed one invalid path end)
Updated tc_rubble waypoints (fixed one invalid path merge, couple invalid path ends and turned couple paths that involve jumping into avoid enemy ones)
Updated obj_thanatos waypoints (fixed one bad cross waypoint layout)
Updated ps_marie waypoints (fixed one bad cross waypoint layout in blue spawn area)
Updated ps_river waypoints (fixed 3 missing goback waypoints)
Updated ps_strorm_r1 waypoints (fixed one missing goback waypoint in red spawn area)
Updated psobj_thanatos waypoints (fixed one bad cross waypoint layout)
Updated sd_force waypoints (converted them into up-to-date waypoint version and fixed 3 invalid path ends, however these waypoints would need some real changes)
Updated sd_oberland waypoints (fixed 4 invalid path ends ie. missing goback waypoints)
Updated tc_iwojima waypoints (fixed one invalid path end in red spawn)
ADDED client command 'wpt position <index>' (it will print 'index' waypoint position in a map using x/y/z coordinate, it prints your current position as well)
ADDED client command 'pathwpt printpath <index>' (it will list all waypoints with their types in 'index' path, works pretty much the same as 'printall' command so if the path is really long it will print just 22 waypoints and will wait for you to repeat the same command to continue with the next set of waypoints)
FIXED client command 'pathwpt printall' (if used to print all paths it printed more lines than a non steam (WON) console could show so you couldn't see/check all paths, now it prints only 22 lines in one go)
UPDATED client command 'wpt info' (will now take two arguments so you don't need to move next to the waypoint you can just type in waypoints' index, order of the arguments doesn't matter, 'wpt info more 12' will do the same thing as 'wpt info 12 more' so if you have a key binding it will still work the way it used to, also fixed a problem with building up the short description if you used the 'wpt info full' option - it used to add extra '&' sign at certain cases)
Updated tc_caen waypoints (turned some paths into avoid enemy ones, changed layout of couple paths in blue team spawn area and fixed one invalid path end close to red spawn)
ADDED client command 'wpt printall' (it will list all used waypoints with their flags/tags, works the same as the other list commands so it'll print just 22 waypoints in console and will wait for you to repeat the command to print another set of 22 waypoints till it gets to the very last waypoint)
Updated ps_splinter waypoints (converted them into up-to-date waypoint version and fixed 19 bugs of invalid path end or path merge, yet these waypoints would need major work to make them bug free)
Updated obj_paradise waypoints (converted them into up-to-date waypoint version and fixed 14 bugs of invalid path ends, however these waypoints would still need some real work to make them fit todays standards)
Updated tc_golan waypoints (actually they are brand new waypoints, instead of updating and fixing the previous waypoints I decided to create new based on triggers that allow the bots to play the map with some sort of wisdom, I mean the triggers dynamically open/close paths according to actual game state)
